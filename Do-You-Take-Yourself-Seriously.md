Do You Take Yourself Seriously?

你有认真的对待自己嗎？

<!--more-->

When is the last time you had an opinion but didn’t share it with anyone because you didn’t think anyone would care? When is the last time you got really excited about an idea you had but then never pursued it because you decided it wasn’t good enough? When is the last time you started to make something but gave up before you finished because you didn’t think anyone would like it?

何时是最近一次你有了自己的看法，但却没有分享给任何一个人，因为你觉得别人不会在乎，是什么时候？你最近一次你对自己的想法感到特别兴奋，但是从未追求过它因为你觉得还并不够好，是什么时候？你最近一次开始决定做一些事情但是在结束前放弃了因为你觉得没有人会喜欢，是什么时候？

You’ll read a lot of articles that tell you to “just do it,” — don’t worry what others will think, keep going, keep persevering, don’t give up!

你将会读过成千上万本书告诉你 “just do it”-不要管别人怎么想，继续向前，继续坚持，永不放弃！

But if you don’t take yourself seriously you’ll never be able to take any of that advice. Because you’ll always be able to convince yourself that what you’re doing isn’t important enough.

但是如果你不认真的看待你自己，这些建议将毫无用处。因为你将永远的告诉你自己你在做的事情从来都不够重要。

I didn’t take myself seriously for a long time. I still struggle with taking myself seriously. I couldn’t even put a finger on what it was I was doing to myself until about a year ago. But finally I realized there’s this thing some people have — this ability to get excited about something they’re doing and go for it with some sort of crazy abandon. This ability to remain focused and stand firm and get on top of a mountain and shout out what they want for all to hear (so to speak).

我已经很久没有认真的对待自己。我仍然努力的试着认真的对待自己。大约一年以前吧，我甚至说不上来我对自己做什么。但是终于，察觉到有一些是别人拥有的能力 ———— 对自己做的事情感到兴奋，并且用一种近乎疯狂追求的态度，努力实现它的能力。这种能力能保持专注，能让你立场坚定，能让你登上高峰将自己的梦想大声的喊出来让所有人都听见。

And I knew I had the ability to climb up a mountain and do the same thing, but I would always talk myself out of it. And I finally realized it was because I just didn’t take myself seriously.

并且我知道我有能力登上高峰和做同样酷炫事情，但是我却一直告诉自己我是不行的。最后我发现这是因为我没有认真的对待我自己。

I even struggled writing this article…

我甚至挣扎的写下这段话…

*Why am I writing this? This is stupid. This is repetitive. Hasn’t someone else said this before but better? Do I even know what I’m trying to say? No one is going to read this. I should go work on something else. This is a waste of time.*

*我为什么在写这些？这很蠢，这是重复无意义的，难道之前没有人说过比这更好的吗？我知道我要说什麽吗?？没有人会读这篇文章。我应该去干点别的事情。这真是浪费时间。*

Those were my thoughts almost every time I tried to create something new. I didn’t take my own opinions, my ideas or even what I wanted for my life seriously.

每当我试着创造一些新东西时，这些想法就充斥着我的大脑。我没有正视自己的意见，自己的想法甚至是自己对生活的期望。

**So what happens when you don’t take yourself seriously?**

**如果不重视自己会如何呢**

You spend a lot of time dreaming but not actually doing. You come up with ideas but you stop yourself before you even try.

你花费大量时间幻想做白日夢但从来不付出实际行动。你有很多想法但却从来试都没有去试。

Or you do try something but you give up quickly because you decide it’s not good enough, no one will like it, and it was a stupid idea anyway.

或者是你尝试着做一些事情但是马上就放弃了就因为你觉得这还远远不够好，没有人会喜欢它，或者是这是一个愚蠢的想法等等。

*But the worst part happens ten years later* when you look back on that thing you almost started and you realize there was something there. It wasn’t half as bad as what you thought at the time and you might have really accomplished something if you’d only stuck with it.

但是最可怕的事情是十年之后，当你回想起当初，你的想法几乎已经开始，并且意识到这个想法是可行的。其实当时的情况完全没有你想象的那么糟，你需要做的就是努力的坚持下来完成你想做的事情。

**So what happens when you don’t take yourself seriously?**

**如果不重视自己会如何呢**

You’ll eventually see someone else who had the same idea you had, but she shared it with the world, she did something with it.

你最终会看到一个人和你拥有同样的想法，但是他将这个想法和世界分享，并且做了一些事情。

“But it was the exact same idea!” you say. Yes, it was — but that person took it seriously. That person took themselves seriously. That person said, “this is interesting to me, so it could be interesting to someone else,” and they did something with it.

“但是这完全是一样的想法！”你说。没错，是的，但是那个人视这个想法为珍宝，那个人重视自己所有的想法，那个人说 “这对我来说十分有趣，所以它应该也能吸引到别人” 然后朝着这个方向努力。

**So what happens when you don’t take yourself seriously?**

**如果不重视自己会如何呢**

You resent people who do. You look at people who promote themselves and their ideas and you think they’re egotistical or ridiculous. Or you look at people who you admire and you lament the fact that you could never ever accomplish what they have.

你会愤恨那些重视自己的人。你看着那些提升自己能力和想法的人们然后觉得他们的想法是自以为是的荒唐。或者是你将看着那些你崇拜的人并且哀叹自己永远不能达到和他们同样地位的事实。

**So what happens when you don’t take yourself seriously?**

**如果不重视自己会如何呢**

You sabotage yourself. You rush through a half-hearted execution and don’t give yourself the time you need to learn something new, or do it the right way. And when it doesn’t turn out the way you wanted you decide it was a total waste of time. But you might have had a totally different outcome if you’d first accepted the fact that it might take time but that the time would be worth it because you believed in it.

你将摧毁你自己。你半心半意的匆匆执行，不给自己学习新知识或是认真做事的时间。当事情最终没有按照你的预期发展时你就觉得这完全是在浪费时间。但是如果在一开始你就接受这个並花时间去做或学习，你也许会有一个完全不同的结果，因为你相信它，这一切都是值得的！

**So what happens when you don’t take yourself seriously?**

**如果不重视自己会如何呢**

You get depressed. You get angry at yourself. You get disappointed in yourself. You wonder why you haven’t done anything. You feel like you never will. You feel like it’s too late. But it’s not.

你将变得抑郁。你将对自己生气。你将对自己失望。你会问自己为什么自己什么事都做不好，你觉得自己永远都不能做好，你觉得一切都太晚了，但并不是。

Every piece of every tiny little thing you’ve ever thought is filled with possibilities. You don’t know what. And that’s scary. You might not yet know how. And that’s hard. But when you take yourself seriously, you give yourself enough credit to know that you can figure it out. When you know in your heart that you and your ideas are important, you will give every idea you have a fighting chance.

你曾经的每一件细微的思想都充满了无限可能性。但是你没有发现这点，这是很可怕的，你可能还不知道会如何，这是困难的。但是当你重视你自己，给予自己足够的信任来认识到自己是能解决问题的。这是十分重要的当从内心认识到自己和自己的想法，你将会给予每一个想法一个奋斗的机会！

That might mean speaking up at work. Or it might mean just finishing that one thing you’ve been thinking about forever. Or it might mean tweeting about it, making a video or blog post about it, or getting on a stage and sharing it with an audience.

这也许可能是着在工作中将你的想法说出来，或许可能是仅仅去完成一件你将会一直思考的事情，或许可能是在tweet上发布这个想法，制作一个视频或是在博客中记录它，或者是在一个讲台上将这个想法分享给听众。

When you take yourself seriously you will make others take you seriously. You will put your ideas out there. You won’t hide them. You won’t delete them. You will keep trying.

当你认真重视自己的时候，别人也将认真的看待你。你将会把你的想法放在那裡，不会将它们隐藏，你不会将它们删除，你将会坚持尝试任何新的事物。

**Take yourself seriously.**

**请认真的重视你自己**

Don’t treat your ideas like they’re nothing, don’t treat yourself like you’re nothing, because you and your ideas are important and meaningful and have the potential to become so much more than you realize.

请别轻视自己的想法，更别轻视自己，因为你和你的想法是如此的重要和有意义，它们的潜力将远超你的想象。

TRUST ME…

请相信我！
